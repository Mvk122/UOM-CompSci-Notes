* I've designed a cloud-native trading system with a focus on algorithmic trading that prioritises scalability and security in terms of:
	* Compute, through many horizontally scalable individual components.
	* People working on the system by abstraction of common trading functions like data cleaning, aggregation, signal generation and risk management, allowing for:
		* Faster development of trading strategies as quantitative developers will only need to focus on developing strategies.
		* A reduced risk of faults as people will only need to focus on their individual fields of expertise without having to consider the operations of the rest of the system.
