# Theory Of Games

## Definitions
* `Best Response`: For a given player and all opponent strategies fixed, the best response is the strategy for the player that gives the best payoff.
* `Nash Equilibrium`: A strategy profile (strategy for every player in the game) if each strategy in the profile is a best response to all of the others.
	* If players are playing the Nash, no player has any incentive to change its strategy unilaterally as there wouweld be no strategy that has a higher payoff with a change of strategy.
## Best Response
* It is always possible to find a best response if there is a finite strategy space.
* If the strategy space is infinite then it may not always be possible.
