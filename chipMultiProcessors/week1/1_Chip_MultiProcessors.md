## Why Do we need Multicore Processors? 
* The magnitude of speed increases in single core processors has decreased significantly due to:
	* Power consumption and heat dissipation.
	* Architectural approaches to increasing processor speeds have been exhausted.
* Hence increasing the number of transistors has come with using multiple cores.

## Challenges with Multicore Processors
* It is hard to program multicore processors as we need to decide:
	* How are processors connected.
	* How is the memory organised.
