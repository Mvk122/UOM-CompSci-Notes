# Data Science Steps

## Frame the problem
* Find data for a problem that needs to be solved and address the steps that need to be taken to produce an end result.
* Use data that is available to find a problem that can be solved with it.

## Get the raw data
* Structured data: Many types connected in a structured way.
* Unstructured: many types that are not linked eg videos.

## Pre-process the data
* Clean the data.
* Remove duplicate data.
* Address missing data
    * `Missing completely at random`: Data is missing independant of observed or unobserved variables.
    * `Missing at random`: Data is misisng based on some unobserved or missing data.
    * `Missing not at random`: The missing data is missing due to observed or unobserved variables.
* Modify the data to a form that is easier to process

## Explore the data
* Gain insights over the data.

## Analyse/ Model the data
* Build a model that simulates the data.

## Evaluate the results
* Does the model fit with new data.
* Does it make correct predicitons.

## Use the data
* Use the results to make a conclusion
