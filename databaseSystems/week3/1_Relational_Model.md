# The Relational Model

* Relations are defined as `R(A1, A2, A3)` where R is a Relation name and A are attributes of R.
* Relations are entries in a database that link to each other.

## Keys

* Keys are attributes/ sets of attributes that uniquely identify a row in a table and creates relationships

### Key Types
* `Primary Key:` An identifier that identifies a row in a table. It is a specific set of attributes that uniquely identifies a row (`candidate key`). It can also be its own field like an ID.
    * They have to be unique. 
    * Non-null
    * Never Changing
    * Simple
    * Ideally a number

* `Foreign Key:` An attribute in one table which is used as the `Primary Key` in another table. Used to reference a specific object in another table.
