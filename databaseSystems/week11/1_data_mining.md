    * `Incomplete`: Missing attribute values
    * `Noisy`: Containing errors
    * `Inconsistent`: Contains discrepencies like type differences

* It fits the model of the warehouse and not the data's original shape.
* It is indexed for optimised performance
* It provides specific support
* Has a large amount of intergrated data
