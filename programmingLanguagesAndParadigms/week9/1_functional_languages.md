# Functional Languages

## Properties of Functional Languages
* They are like any other data and can be defined without being named.
* Functions can be inputs and outputs of other functions.
* They can be reasoned about like mathematical functions:
    * If $f(x) = g(x)$ for all x then f = g.
    * Thus it should be trivial to show that functions are identical barring performance metrics.
    * Furthermore, functions shouldn't have side effects.
