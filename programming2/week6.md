# Secure Coding

Developers will often prioritise rushing/ completing projects by compromising on security by:
* Disabling built-in security to remove error messages.
* Implementing workarounds that nullify the security measures. 
* Copying and pasting code from StackOverflow that may not be reliable and is trusted by the amount of views/ reputation the question has.
* Not having had adequate training on proper security practices. 

Developers have trouble working on secure code because:
* There is inadequate tooling for cross-language/cross-platform development.
* They do not have adequate security training.
* By combining multiple stacks, their codebases reach edge cases that are hard to diagnose and find credible solutions for.

The issues can be resolved by:
* Not disabling security measures and trying to understand their purposes. 
* Not implicitly trusting answers on online forums
* Library designers should create clean and helpful error messages to aid developers in properly fixing their issues as opposed to disabling the features
* Library designers should disable depreceated features rather than leaving them in
* Using or building automatic tools to check for security holes
