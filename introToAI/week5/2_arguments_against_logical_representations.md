# Arguments Against Using Logical Representations

## The Frame Problem
* For problem sets larger than the block problem, there are likely many more 'non-actions' eg parts of the problem that are unchanged than parts that are changed during a specific action.
* Hence writing statements gets tedious as all these non-actions need to be stated in every part of the problem.

## The Qualification Problem
* In realistic scenarios, it is hard to write down the precise conditions under which actions have their prescribed effects. 
* What if a robot was moving the blocks in the blocks problem? We would need to take into account the micromovements that need to take place to ensure the tower doesn't topple as well as any wind that is present in the situation among other things. 
* Hence it is hard to define exactly the outputs given a specific input.
