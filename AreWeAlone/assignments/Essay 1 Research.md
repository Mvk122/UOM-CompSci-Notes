Discuss the possibility of life on a single site of your choosing, elsewhere in our solar system. Possible sites might include Mars, Europa, Venus, Enceladus, Titan, or elsewhere. Make sure your answer includes discussion of existing and/or planned investigations using telescopes or spacecraft. 

We recommend you start preparing you answer with readings and sources from **Modules 2 and 3**.

Site Chosen: Mars

## Reasons to believe there may be life on Mars
* Presence of subsurface water under the poles in Mars Christensen, P. R. (2006). "Water at the Poles and in Permafrost Regions of Mars". _Elements_. **3** (2): 151–155. [doi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doi_(identifier) "Doi (identifier)"):[10.2113/gselements.2.3.151](https://doi.org/10.2113%2Fgselements.2.3.151).
	* Presence of liquid water on the surface of present day Mars. (It might be sand) https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasa-confirms-evidence-that-liquid-water-flows-on-todays-mars/ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonal_flows_on_warm_Martian_slopes
* Natural Methane on Mars which can be produced by biological sources. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_methane_on_Mars
	* It can also be achieved geologically, thus lending credence to the fact that Mars is still volcanically active. This is a good sign of presence of life on mars as geological activity leads to: 
		* Volcanic activity can contribute to the presence of geothermal energy sources. On Earth, certain extremophiles, organisms that thrive in extreme conditions, can be found near hydrothermal vents at the bottom of the ocean
		* Volcanic processes contribute to the creation of diverse mineralogical landscapes. The presence of various minerals can impact the chemical composition of the soil and rocks on Mars. Certain minerals could serve as potential habitats or provide nutrients that could support microbial life.
* Presence of organic molecules on Mars https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/news/2023/august/organic-molecules-martian-crater-help-reconstruct-planets-history.html
	* They are to be analyzed by the Mars Sample Return Mission
