# Are We Alone

## The Possibility of Life
* A common argument to life existing elsewhere in the universe is the scale of the universe necessitates that even if life has a very low probability of formation, it has to exist in many places in the universe.
* However this isn't proof of life existing elsewhere in the universe, it just states that it would be strange for there not to be life elsewhere in the universe.
* We also need to consider our biases as to what we perceive as evidence of alien life. Often "sightings" of alien life come from cultures that tend to believe in extraterrestrial beings. Eg many sightings coming from the military and western nations.

## What kind of evidence would we need?
* Before we look for evidence of extraterrestrial life we need to define what exactly we would be looking for. This requires a definition for:
	* What is "life", perhaps what we find in the universe may be outside the understand for what we consider to be life indicators.
	* What would we even consider to be signs of life? A possibility is molecules that we know to be only of biological origin. However, given the difference in geographies on different planets, molecules produced by life on earth could be created through some other geological or photochemical processes elsewhere.
	* Where would we look? Life could be vastly different from what we have on Earth, with different requirements and evolution.

## Why this search is important
* It would challenge our current thinking on:
	* Evolution
	* Where life came from 
	* In what circumstances can life survive in.
* Finding life could instill a sense of humility in humanity and destabilise the notion of humans being the center of everything.
* Even if we don't find life, doing the search would allow us to discover other things along the way, eg in terms of:
	* Geochemistry.
	* Stars and the universe.

## Ethical Implications of the discovery of Alien Life
* If we were to discover alien life, there are many questions as to what we should do:
	* Who should we contact?
	* How should the news be broken?
	* Should we contact the alien life?
	* What would we say to alien life?
* When looking for life, what precautions should we take:
	* Should we tread lightly on other planets and only send probes?

## Should we be proactive in seeking contact with extraterrestrials?
* We are already sending signals about our presence into outer space through electromagnetic radiation from our technology.
* But when sending a message out deliberately, we need to consider:
	* Is it a good idea to send a message out in the first place? 
	* What would we even say?
	* Why is it up to me to decide what to say?
* There is a lot of debate as to whether we want to be seen by aliens who may see us as a target once they discover our presence, crushing us like we would an ant.
