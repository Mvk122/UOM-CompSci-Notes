# Challenges with SETI
* If 3000 technical civilizations were spread throughout the Milky Way, the average distance between them would be `1000 lightyears`. This creates a few problems for SETI:
	* Due to signals becoming fainter with the square of the distance, there is great difficulty detecting `leakage radiation`.
	* Detecting deliberate transmissions will also be difficult as they will be pointed at a particular direction in the sky and will also be much rarer than leakage radiation. We will need to be pointing our telescopes at the right direction to detect them.
	* Communicating over interstellar distances would take 1000s of years.
	* SETI signals are likely to be transitory.
	* We have no idea which central frequency will be used by other civilizations i.e: 
		* The frequency.
		* broadband vs narrowband.
		* Rapidly pulsed vs modulated
	* Advanced civilizations might be using different, superior technologies other than radio waves.
