# SETI (Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence)
* Began in the late 1950s when it was realised that very large radio telescopes could be used to send and receive messages over enormous interstellar distances.
* Radio signals are favoured for SETI because they propagate unimpeded over enormous distances without suffering from significant absorption.

## Operations of Radio Telescopes

* The parabolic surface of the telescope brings the radio waves to a single point, the focus of the telescope.
* At the focal point is a receiver box that includes a `central corrugated feed horn`.
* The radio waves are fed don the horn, inducing tiny electrical currents.
* The currents are amplified.
* A digitizer samples the amplified signal to create a digital stream that is stored.
