# Where To Look

## Within the Solar System
* For planets in close proximity, the effects of `panspermia` could be relevant.
* The moons of Jupiter and Saturn are frozen over, however the internal heat generated within the moons means that there could be large oceans of liquid water under the surface, allowing for simple life to evolve.

## Testing for Life
* Chemical tests can be used to search for the signatures of simple life.
* These include looking for chemical elements and compounds associated with biology.
