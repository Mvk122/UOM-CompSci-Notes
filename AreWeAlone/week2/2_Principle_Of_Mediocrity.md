# Principle Of Mediocrity
* The idea that there is nothing exceptional about human beings, our solar system and our location in the galaxy. Further it states that given the right conditions, life should nearly always emerge.

## The Drake Equation
![[U00Rqzv5qNjDaa9q_40Azb-pzCEyngdNg.jpg]]
* An attempt to estimate the current number of intelligent, communicating civilizations in our galaxy.
* This was done by taking the product of 7 factors.:
	* The rate of formation of stars in the galaxy.
	* The fraction of stars with planetary systems.
	* The number of planets per solar system with a suitable environment for life.
	* The fraction of planets in which life appears.
	* The fraction of life bearing planets on which intelligent life appears.
	* The fraction of civilizations that develop technology to release detectable signs of their existence into space.
	* The length of time such civilizations release detectable signals into space.

## Using the Principle of Mediocrity within the Drake Equation
* The first 3 factors of the drake equation are well known due to advances in astronomy.
* Using the principle of mediocrity, we can set all the life bearing factors to 1.
* This simplifies to $N=L$. 

## Additional Factors to the Drake Equation
* The reappearance factor, i.e the possibility that a technical civilization may arise more than once in the history of a planet.
* A METI factor, i.e the fraction of civilizations that are deliberately engaged in broadcasting interstellar transmissions designed to be easily detectable.
