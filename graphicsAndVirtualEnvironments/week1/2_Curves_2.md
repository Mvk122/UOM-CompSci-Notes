# Velocity

* The velocity is also known as the tangent to the curve at a given point.
* The differential term can be calculated by differentiating the equation of the bezier curve.

# Curvature (Acceleration)

* Can be calculated the same as velocity, except it is using the second derivative.

# Orders of Continuity

## C0
* The curves connect but there can be a sharp kick/corner at the boundary
## G1
* The tangents at the connection are pointing in the same direction.
## C1
* The tangent at the connection are exactly the same
## C2
* The tangent and also the derivative of the tangent are exactly the same at the connection
