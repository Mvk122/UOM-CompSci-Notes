# Definitions

* `Polylines`: A sequence of vertices connected by straight line segments.
* `Spline`: A curve that connects 2 or more points.

# Ways of Representing Geometry
## Explicit
* Representations like point clouds and polygon meshes which are easy to work with and provide precise control over the shape of objects.
## Implicit
* Representations like algebraic surfaces and level sets which are more simple and efficient.


# Ways of Constructing Curves

* `Interpolation`: The curve passes through all control points.
* `Approximation`: The curve generally approximates its way around the points, allowing us to use fewer control points, giving us more flexibility and allowing for the simplification of more complex curves.
