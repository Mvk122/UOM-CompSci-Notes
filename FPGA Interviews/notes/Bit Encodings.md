# One Hot
* Only 1 bit out of the number is a 1 and the rest are 0s.
* The value is the index of the 1 bit.
* `001` -> 0, `010` -> 1, `100` -> 2. 
* `N` states can be represented with `N` bits.
# Gray Encoding
* An encoding wherein two successive values only differ by 1 bit.
* $2^n$ states are represented by $n$ bits.
* Used to prevent spurious output from switches and facilitate error correction
