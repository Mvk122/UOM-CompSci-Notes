* How to implement a multiplexer in FPGA. 
	* Talk about LUTs
	* Verilog Code
	* Timing Implications
* Network protocol stack (TCP, UDP, Ethernet)
* FPGA Networking (AXI, AHB, APB, PCIE)
* Hardware Sorting Algorithms
	* brick sort

## Re-Study Following Modules
* Processor Microarchitecture
* System Architecture
* Implementing SOC
* Operating Systems

## Verilog Constructs
* Make a list of rules in FPGAs that always need to be followed
	* Blocking vs non blocking 
	* How latches are formed and how to avoid them
* Functions vs tasks
* Mealy and moore designs
* Sync vs async designs
