# Main Memory

## Definitions
`Random Access`: Any random address will get the same treatment and access time as any other. In modern contexts, not all memory accesses have the same access time however.

## Static RAM (SRAM)
* Genuinely randomly accessible. 
* Fairly compact.
* Low power, especially when not in use.
* Retains data only whilst powered (volatile). 
* Can be manufactured on logic chips and are extensively used.
* Used as RAM in small processor systems and as cache in big processor systems.
* Are used as buffer memories in interfaces like USB.
* Are used as temporary storage in hardware FSMs.

## Multi Port SRAM
* Marcocells with dual or more busses capable of simultaneous memory access.
* They are not often worthwhile as there is a 30% speed reduction and wiring area is doubled hence it is less dense and requires a higher amount of energy than single port SRAM.
