* CPU caches are much faster subsets of the main memory that store frequently used data for quick access by the processor

## 1b
* spatial locality: If a memory location was used, locations around it are also likely to be used in the near future. This is related to the cache line size as a larger cache line size stores data locations close to the initial location.
* Temporal locality: If a memory location was used, it is likely to be used again. This is related to the cache size, associativity and the chosen replacement policy as these have an impact on how long a memory location stays in the cache.

## 1c
* Spatial: when accessing a stack or a contiguous array
* Temporal: When using a counter that gets incremented on each computation

## 1d
* Having a very large L1 cache is not practical as it is very expensive, large and has high power requirements hence multiple layers of caches are used as even with a low miss rate, the performance penalty is large due to the speed of the processor and how slow main memory is.
* Furthermore, multiple layers are used as multiple cores might have their own L1 caches while still sharing some data hence it is good if this shared data is replicated in the L2 cache.
* Having an L2 cache increases the hit rate and reduces the miss penalty.
