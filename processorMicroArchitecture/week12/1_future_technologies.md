# Future Technologies

* Moore's law is dying and the progress of transistor densities is reducing.
* Quantum effects are making minituarisation of CMOS circuits difficult.

## Power
* Power and energy efficiency is now the limiting factor in high-performance ICs.
    * Less power usage means longer battery life.
    * Less power usage means less cooling is used.
* Heat is generated and energy is lost when charge finds its way to a lower potential in CMOS circuits.
* Power is being managed using:
    * `clock gating`: Isolating parts of the clock tree that are not in use.
    * `Glitch reduction`: Reducing how much nets switch unnecessarily due to glitches by logic races.
    * `Latching values`: Values in long distance busses should be latched to prevent them from flapping about, wasting power.
    * `Dynamic voltage scaling`: Slowing the clock down and reducing the supply voltage.
    * `Preventing Leakage`

## Variation
* As features become narrower, the effect of 'rough edges' like voltage irregularities becomes more significant.

## Going vertical
* 3d stacking technology is being used to improve the performance of CMOS chips.

# Future Technologies

## Skyrmions
* Nano scale knots in magnets can be used for boolean computing.
* Gates can be created with nanotech magnetic logic gates.

## Neuromorphic computing
* Chips that are modelled as neurons.
* Can be done with CMOS or skyrmions.
