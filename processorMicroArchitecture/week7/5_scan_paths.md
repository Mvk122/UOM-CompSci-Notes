# Scan Paths

* Scan chains are used to check the state of the system when the clock is stopped in the boundaries of logic blocks.
* This is done by using latches between logic blocks.
* This technique improves the testability of a circuit by allowing for more `controllability` and `observability`.
* Works best when the design is `partitioned` to allow for fewer reachable states.
