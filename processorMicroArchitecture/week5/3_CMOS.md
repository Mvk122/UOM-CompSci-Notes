# CMOS

* As `nMOS` and `pMOS` have different transmission characteristics, `CMOS` uses them in a complementary fashion to ensure all states of a logic function are transmitted properly.
* They contain a `pull-up-network` made with `pMOS` that uses the power supply voltage to supply `1` when the logic function made with the pMOS returns `True`.
* The alternate is true for the `pull-down-network` made with `nMOS` and the ground.
* The `pull-up` and `pull-down` networks thus need to be opposite with the functions they return.

## CMOS network building blocks

### Inverter
![Inverter](../img/inverter.png)
* The inverter is made with a `pMOS` and `nMOS` in `parallel`. 


### Series and parallel transistor combinations
* `pMOS` and `nMOS` respectively can be placed in series or parallel to create logic.
