# Instruction Set Architectures

* They are the interface between the software and hardware and provides instructions for writing software to run the hardware.

## CISC vs RISC
* `CISC`: Complex instruction set that has many specialized instructions.
* `RISC`: Reduced instruction sets that simplifies the processor by efficiently implementing only the instructions that are frequently used with less common operations being implemented as subroutines.

## What makes a good ISA?
* Enabling high performance
* Does not get in the way
* Compatible with existing hardware and software

## Open Source ISAs
* Many ISAs require royalties for using their designs.
* This can get in the way of computer designers restricting their freedom to design.
* Hence open source ISAs are helpful for designing products with chips that are not extremely high end.
