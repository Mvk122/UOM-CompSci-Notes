## Avenues for Optimising SNNs
* Don't have a global clock, use asynchronous communication (event listeners).
* Use spikes instead of constant streams as data transfer is more energy intensive than compute.
* Be extremely parallel 
* Target low power, real time dynamic applications.


## To Research
* Long Short Term Memory

## To Do
* Clone the intel neuromorphic challenge code and read through it. 
* Sign up for phase 2 of the competition.
