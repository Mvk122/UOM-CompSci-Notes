# Ideas
* Compare and contrast why STFT was used for preprocessing instead of using the raw data.
	* [Other papers using different encoders](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2634-4386/ace737/pdf) (Section 2.1 paragraph 3)

## Introduction
* Why are spiking neural networks needed. 
	* More power efficient and with lower latency, can be used on edge and small devices.
* Issues with current spiking neural network implementations with regards to denoising applications and why the Gated Spiking Neuron is better.
