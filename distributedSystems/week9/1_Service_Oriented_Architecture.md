# Service Oriented Architecture
* An architectural style where services are `encapsulated` into independent units.
* The main challenge of a SOA is service composition to make sure that the services operate in harmony.
	* This involves ensuring that services have well defined interfaces to communicate with them.
## Definitions
* #service: A discrete unit of functionality that can be accessed remotely, via a network and updated independently. Services can make use of other services.
