# Cloud Computing
* Is a term used for `utility computing` which defines a set of internet based applications, storage and computing services to support users needs.
* It is the backbone of other technologies like `Internet of Things` or `Big Data` that require the cloud to collect and process data.
* They are generally implemented on cluster computers (a set of interconnected computers that cooperate to provide a single integrated computing capability) to provide the necessary scale and performance required by cloud services.
