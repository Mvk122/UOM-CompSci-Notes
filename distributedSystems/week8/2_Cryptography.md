# Cryptography
* Cryptography is a security technique used to make messages in transit unintelligible until the receiver is able to decrypt it.
## Secure Channels
* A secure channel protects senders and receivers against:
	* `Interception`: Done by ensuring confidentiality, ensuring that messages cannot be eavesdropped by intruders. This is done with `encryption`
	* `Modification and Fabrication`: Done through protocols for `mutual authentication` and message `integrity`.

### Secure Channel Authentication

* Consider the case where both parties already have a shared secret key.
* When Alice sends a message to Bob, he needs to verify that the message was actually sent by Alice.
* Hence Bob sends Alice a "challenge" message that Alice must send back after encrypting it with the secret key.
* Bob will then know that the message was sent by the real Alice if he can decrypt the message and retrieve the same challenge token sent to Alice.
* This process is then done in reverse by Alice to check for Bob's authentication.
### Secure Channel Integrity (Digital Signatures)
* To ensure that a message was not fabricated or modified, digital signatures can be used to `sign` a message, uniquely binding a signature to content to prove that the content was created by someone and has not been modified.
* This can be done with `public key` cryptography wherein:
	* The sender publishes a public key for everyone to see.
	* The sender then encrypts a message using their private key.
	* The public key can be used to decrypt the message.
	* The only way the public key can decrypt the message is if the private key was used to sign the message, hence any message decrypted using the public key must have been created by someone with the private key.

## Controlling Access to Resources
* Controlling access to an object means protecting it against requests generated by unauthorised subjects.
* It is done using a `reference monitor` which records which subject may do what.
