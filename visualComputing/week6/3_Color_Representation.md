# Color Representation

## The Human Eye

* There are 2 types of cones that detect light:
	* `Rods`: For low light vision and they don't detect colour.
	* `Cones`: For colour, they are bad in low light.
* There are 3 distinct wavelengths namely red, green and blue that the human eye is most sensitive to.

## Colour Standardisation
* Standards are required to describe which specific wavelengths respond to red, green or blue.
* The amount of R,G,B are called the `tristimulus` values, denoted by X, Y and Z.
* They are normalised with the formula $x = X/(X + Y + Z)$ (x is given, the pattern holds for x, y and z):
* Thus $x + y + z = 1$
* Hence, only x and y need to be stored and z can be calculated.
