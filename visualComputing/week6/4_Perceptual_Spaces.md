# Perceptual Spaces

* Perceptual spaces are needed for describing colours to humans as the same differences in RGB correspond to much different changes in perceived colour depending on the origin of the change. (Equal distances on the CIE diagram do not correspond to equal changes in perceived colour)

## IHS model

* A method of representing colours using:
* `Intensity`: Weighted average of RGB (brightness). The weights can be arbitrary and different programs use different weights.
* `Hue`: The basic colour, represented as an angle between 0 and 359
* `Saturation`: The depth of the colour, a lower depth refers to more white dilution. 

## Segmentation with HSV
* Segmentation can be used to highlight portions of an image with a certain colour.
