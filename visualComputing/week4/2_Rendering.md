* To save on computational complexity, we can only approximate the interaction of light and matter.

## Global vs Local Illumination 
![[Pasted image 20230529022729.png]]
* `Local Illumination`: Surfaces are illuminated directly by light sources.
* `Global Illumination`: Surfaces are illuminated by light sources but also bounce light that illuminate other surfaces (and thus get illuminated by other surfaces as well).

## Diffuse vs Specular Reflection 
### Diffuse 
* Absorption and uniform re-radiation hence objects are the colour they are because they only reflect a specific wavelength. 
### Specular
* Reflection at the air/surface level hence the colour of the specular reflection is the same as the light source.

## Types of Reflectivity
* Reflections are generally a mix of the following:
### Diffuse Reflection 
* Incident rays are reflected in all directions from the surface, making the surface look dull or matte.
### Specular Reflection 
* Reflects an incoming ray like a perfect mirror.
