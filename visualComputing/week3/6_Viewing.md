## Viewing Pipeline
1. `Modelling transformation`: Positioning the objects in the scene.
2. `Viewing transformation`: Translating the camera in the scene.
3. `Projection transformation`: Projecting the 3D scene into a 2D scene.
4. `Clip to volume`: Clipping the projection to the volume being viewed
5. `Perspective division`: Modifications to the perspective of the view.
6. `Viewport Transformation`: Transforming the world coordinates to screen coordinates.

## Default View

* Projecting of all points in the view onto the Z=0 plane
* The projection of points onto the Z=0 plane is the view that is rendered to the camera.
* The projection can change the shape of objects.
