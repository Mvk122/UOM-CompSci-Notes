## Addition and Subtraction
* Add the respective X, Y and Z coordinates excluding W.

## Scalar Multiplication
* Multiply each coordinate except W by the scalar constant

## Vector Magnitude
* Refers to the length of the vector.
* *$magnitude = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}$

## Vector Normalisation
* The vector with the same direction but a magnitude of 1.
* $newvector = vector* 1/(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2})$

## Dot Product
* Is the scalar product of the individual components of both vectors.
* $dotproduct = (x_1 * x_2) + (y_1 * y_2) + (z_1 * z_2)$
* For `normalised vectors`, their dot product is the cosine of the angle between them.

## Cross Product
* Returns a Vector that is perpendicular to both vectors that were input.
