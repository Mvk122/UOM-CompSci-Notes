# REST APIs
* REST is an architectural style where the server does not keep track of client state.
* Clients can operate without knowing anything about the server.
* REST can be implemented with any underlying communication methodology however HTTP is generally used the most.
* HTTP verbs eg POST PUT GET DELETE PATCH match neatly to CRUD.
* REST resources are generally identified by a persistent identifier.
* The representation retrieved for a resource should be dependent on the request and not the identifier.
