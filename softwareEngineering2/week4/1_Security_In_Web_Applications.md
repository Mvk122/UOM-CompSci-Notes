## Authentication
* The process of confirming a user's identity.
* It is done by validating credentials and comparing them to those held in a secure database.
* Credentials can be in the form of: 
	* Who you are: Biometrics
	* What you know: Username/ Password
	* What you have: RFID Cards/ USB Tokens
* They can be used in combination for 2 Factor Authentication

## Authorisation
* The process of specifying access rights/privileges to resources.
* It is usually done through role-based authorisation.

## Injection Attacks
* An attacker injects untrusted input which gets processed as part of a command or query.
* Eg Cross Site Request Forgery, Cross Site Scripting, SQL Injection Attacks.
* It can be fixed by using proper input validation and never trusting user inputs.
