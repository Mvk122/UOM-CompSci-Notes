# Privacy In Web Applications
* User data can be sensitive hence needs to be adequately protected to protect their privacy.

## Methods for Ensuring Privacy
### Minimise 
* Limit as much as possible the processing of personal data.
### Separate
* Logically or physically separate the processing of personal data as much as possible.
* This makes it harder to combine or correlate data.
* Furthermore it reduces the impact of a subset of the system being hacked.
### Abstract
* Limit the detail in which personal data is processed through the use of: 
	* Summaries
	* Groups
### Hide
* Make data unlinkable or unobservable through proper authorisation and authentication
### Inform
* Inform users about what, when and how their data is being processed.
### Control
* Provide users adequate control over the processing of their personal data.
### Enforce
* Create legal privacy policies to enforce how data is managed over an entire organisation
### Demonstrate
* Ensure that you are able to show how you are processing personal data in a privacy friendly way.
