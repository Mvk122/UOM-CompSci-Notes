## Golden Rules of Interface Design
### Strive for Consistency
* Consistent sequences of actions should be required in similar situations especially in terms of:
	* Terminology
	* Colours
	* Capitalization
	* Fonts
* Exceptions to the rules can apply for situations like deleting or not echoing passwords but they should be comprehensible and limited in number.
### Seek Universal Usability
* Make a UI that is useable and fits a diverse set of users taking into account: 
	* Explanations for beginners
	* Disabilities 
	* Age ranges
	* Internationalisation 
	* Technological diversities (eg using on a phone or a computer)
	* Advanced features for experts
### Offer Informative Feedback
* For every user action, there should be an interface feedback.
* The size of the feedback feedback should be inversely proportional to its frequency.
### Design Dialogs to Yield Closure
* Sequences of actions should be organized into groups with a beginning, middle and end.
* This allows for:
	* A sense of pride and accomplishment
	* A sense of relief and to drop contingency plans
	* A sign to prepare for the next group of actions
### Prevent Errors
* Users should be prevented from making errors by making use of: 
	* Graying out fields that can't be used
	* Preventing entry of invalid characters
* Error recovery should be simple and the interface should offer simple and constructive instructions to recover from errors.
### Permit Easy Reversal of Actions 
* Actions should be easily reversible to: 
	* Relieve anxiety
	* Encourage exploration of unfamiliar options
### Keep Users in Control
* Users desire the sense that they are in charge of the interface and hence the interface should respond to the user's actions.
### Reduce Short Term Memory Load
* Prevent users from having to memorise things from one page to be used on another.
