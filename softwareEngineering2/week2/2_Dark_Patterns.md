* Interfaces that benefit online services by leading users into making decisions they might otherwise not make.
## Types of Dark Patterns
### Anchoring
* Lacking knowledge in a field, users will become anchored to arbitrary reference points which can be used to make users spend more than they should.

### Unfair Defaults
* Users are unlikely to change default behaviours hence default settings that are unfair to the user can make users unwillingly and unknowingly choose settings that they wouldn't otherwise approve of.

## Growth Hacking
* The methodology of using dark patterns to maximise user growth over a product.
* It uses extensive A/B testing to gauge which designs lead to better metrics for the company.

## A/B Testing
* Running tests on users to see which design interface leads to better metrics.
* This can be ethical but often it can lead to better metrics in an unethical way unknowingly as it is very easy to gauge if a different design benefits the company's bottom line but very difficult to tell if this new design is actually exploiting dark patterns.
