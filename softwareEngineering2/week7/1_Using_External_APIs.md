# Using External APIs
* There are many external APIs and looking for the right one is a search problem where the following criteria should be satisfied: 
	* Does the API fit our requirements? 
	* Is there good documentation provided that is of a good quality?
	* Are there any quotas that are unreasonable for us?

## Programming By Example
* Reusing existing code.
* Can be done by either:
	* Copying and pasting to try and make it work until it works.
	* Trying to understand why and how it works.
