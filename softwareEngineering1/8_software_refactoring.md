# Software Refactoring

* There are 3 types of changes
    * `Corrective Changes`: Bug Fixes
    * `Perfective Changes`: Adding Features
    * `Adaptive Changes`: Changing the code to make it run in a different environment
    * `Preventive Changes`: Prevents problems from occuring in the future without changing the specification or adding features.
* Refactorings are usually preventive changes to reduce the cost of future charges however it is hard to get resources to do it in the short term as it does not increase value to the users.

## Types of Qualitative factors
* `Readability`: How easy should it be for the development teams to work out what an unfamiliar part of the code does.
* `Extensibility`: How easy should it be to add additional functionality to the code.
* `Portability`: How easy should it be to make the code run on a different platform.
* `Localisability`: How easy should it be to make the code suitable for use in different geographic/ cultural areas.

## Tools to Improve Code Quality
* Keep changes small to reduce costs
* Use tools to make the changes
* Use comprehensive test suites
* Use common patterns
