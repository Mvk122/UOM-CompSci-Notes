# Test Driven Development

## The Test Driven Development Process
* Start with what behaviour the program should exhibit.
* Write the tests assuming a "perfect api". Using stubs will help with compilation.
* Run the tests, they should fail at first.
* Write the code, more tests should pass over time.
* Refactor the program if the design needs improving.

## Types of Tests
* `Unit Tests`: Tests specific to a single unit of code.
* `Acceptance tests`: Customer centric scenarios.
