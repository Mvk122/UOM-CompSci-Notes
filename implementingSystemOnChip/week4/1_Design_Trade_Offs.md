* When making a design, the implementation should be thought of from a top down order: 
	1. Algorithms 
	2. Architecture
	3. RTL
	4. Practicalities (power supply, cooling, size limitations)
* There are many ways to produce a correct design, however the best design for a specific scenario will be influenced by :
	* Speed requirements 
	* Power
	* Size
	* Simplicity
