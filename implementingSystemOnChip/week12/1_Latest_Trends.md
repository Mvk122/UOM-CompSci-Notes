# Limits to Moore's Law
## Design
* The amount of devices/ transistors that can be placed on a chip have increased massively however the pace of innovative designs has not kept up.
* This has lead to more of the transistor budget being used on repetitive structures such are more memories and large core counts.
## Physical 
* Within an order of magnitude, atoms are all the same size and we are reaching the point where the dielectric thickness is only a few atoms wide. 
## Manufacturing 
* The beams of light used for photolithography are already much larger than the feature size and using shorter wavelengths of light will be increasingly challenging as optics will need to be made for X-rays.
* Higher resolution can be achieved with electron or ion beams but these beams need to be scanned as opposed to printing, which makes them extremely slow for mass production.
## Economics
* As chips get smaller, more manufacturing processes and expensive machinery are required for making the chips, increasing costs tremendously while requiring the products to still be cheap to the consumer.
* If the benefit of smaller chips is not outweighed by their greater cost, it does not make sense to manufacture smaller chips.
## Supply Voltage Reductions 
* As devices have shrunk, the standard 5V has become too high as: 
	* Power dissipation is too high for the smaller chip sizes. 
	* Transistor dielectric breaks down.
* Thus lower voltages like 3.3V have been used however this has issues:
	* The gap between a 0 and a 1 is reduced at lower voltages, reducing the noise margins available so radiation can produce upsets more easily.

# Variability

* Diffusing atoms act statistically, hence with a larger amount of atoms, there is a strong likelihood that the actual number will be close to the mean. 
* With smaller numbers, the variations are proportionally larger hence components are less reliable and require more redundancy.
