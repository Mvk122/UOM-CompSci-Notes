# Strained Silicon
* Distorting the lattice distances in the silicon structure to increase the mobility of charge carriers, thus making a transistor of a given size faster.
* This can be done through:
	* Doping the source and drain of PMOS transistors.
	* Overlaying the Si on a SiGe substrate which has a different spacing.

# Copper vs Aluminium Interconnects
* Currently, interconnects use aluminium. Copper can be better however as it is more conductive and thus produces less heat which becomes more important as wires shrink.
* Copper is hard to use however, as aluminium is deposited onto the silicon surface whereas when using copper, the entire surface needs to be deposited all over and the remainder needs to be polished away.

# Through-Silicon-Vias

* Vertical wiring created by using deep-reactive-ion-etching to etch holes into the silicon which is then filled with metal.
* It is used as a high bandwidth interconnect between multiple stacked chips. 
## TSV Pros
* High bandwidth. 
* Connects chips from different manufacturing processes 
* Lots of functionality in a small volume
## TSV Cons
* Expensive. 
* Challenges with power dissipation.
