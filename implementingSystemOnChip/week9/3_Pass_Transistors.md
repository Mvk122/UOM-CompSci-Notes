* Are not directly connected to a power supply.
* Are used to pass through signals based on the input, like a switch.
* However since pMOS is bad at transmitting 0 and nMOS the opposite, they are usually combined into a `transmission gate` which is a digital switch.
	* This transmission gate can also be used as a multiplexer.
