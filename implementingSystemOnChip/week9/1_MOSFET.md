* 3 Terminal Devices in a PMOS and NMOS Flavour: 
	* Source: source of charge carriers.
	* Drain: Sink for charge carriers
	* Gate: Potential on gate controls current floor
* There is a 4th terminal, the substrate which are usually omited from figures. The substrate is the opposite of the MOS, i.e P is used in NMOS and N is used in PMOS.
* `pMOS` is pull up hence when the input signal is 0, it connects the output to `VDD`, setting the output to 1.
* `nMOS` is pull down hence when the input signal is 1, it connects the output to ground setting the output to 0.
