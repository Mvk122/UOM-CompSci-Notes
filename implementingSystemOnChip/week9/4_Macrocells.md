# Macrocells
* Some components would be incredibly inefficient in speed/area/power when made with standard gates and are sufficiently common such that they are worth generating differently.
* This typically includes:
	* SRAM
	* ROM 
	* Adder components
* This `macrocell` can then be copied and pasted as necessary as part of the design.
