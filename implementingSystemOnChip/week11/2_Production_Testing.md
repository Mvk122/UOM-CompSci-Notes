# Production Testing 
* Not every manufactured chip will work, production testing runs tests on manufactured chips to test that they work.
### Differences with Testing the Source


### Challenges with Production Testing
* Automatic Test Pattern Generation
* Testing through multiple layers of logic.
* Due to power constraints, cannot test multiple parts of the chip simultaneously.

## Built In Self Test


## Scan Chains
* Wires connected to buried logic blocks to achieve controllability and observability

## Boundary Scans
