## Pad Rings

* Are a form of external contacts that are placed on the periphery of the device.
* Are necessarily large as: 
	* They need to be large enough for a bonding machine to attach a wire.
	* They need to have amplification circuitry to drive off-chip signals.
	* They need to have circuitry for electrical protection
### Advantages
* Are simpler to manufacture as compared to flip chips.
### Disadvantages
* A logically simpler chip might be "pad limited" as in when the pads are placed and spaced, the central core area is not filled.
	* This wasted silicon costs a lot of money.
### Complications
* Since many boards may have numerous peripheral devices on board, not all of which are used concurrently, to save on pad size, these functions can be multiplexed onto the same pads, reducing the pad count.
	* This also allows for the chip to be less specific to
