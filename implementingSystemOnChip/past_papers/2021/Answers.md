# 1a
* x: Either unknown or don't care, means that the value was not set. 
* z: high impedance, a wire is not being driven by any circuits.

# 1b
* They are not handled, delays are not synthesizeable. 
* Can be used to:
	* Model real components that have delays.
	* To make waveforms easier to read (aesthetic)
	* To sequence I/O in a test run.
