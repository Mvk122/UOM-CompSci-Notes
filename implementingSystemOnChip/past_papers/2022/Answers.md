# 1a
* Simultaneous instruction multiple data, where one operation is done on multiple data at once.
* It is used in GPUs to process many pixels with the same operation at once.

## 1b
1. bbb becomes input_2
2. ccc becomes aaa's orignal value
3. aaa becomes input_1
4. ddd becomes input_2

## 1c
* Power gating is when a pMOS (or less commonly nMOS) transistor is used to send power to a component only when it is needed, reducing overall power consumption.=
* When the microcontroller needs to be used, there will be latency starting it up as needed.

## 1d
* 200Mbytes per second.

# 1e
* It means don't care, so the synthesizer can optimise the logic further.
* It means unknown value, suggesting an error condition.
